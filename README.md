# MemberService

This MemberService is a microservice designed to facilitate the management of member data within an organization. It employs a RESTful API architecture for seamless communication
between client applications and the server. Built using Java technologies, the system emphasizes reactive programming principles for enhanced performance and scalability.

## Limitations and Use Case
This microservice was developed as a practice project to explore reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.  
It is not intended for production use but serves as a learning tool to demonstrate modern Java development practices and principles.

## Technologies Used:

- __Spring Framework:__ Core Framework for building enterprise Java applications.
- __Project Lombok:__ Library for reducing boilerplate code in Java.
- __Spring WebFlux:__ Provides reactive programming support for building asynchronous, non-blocking web applications.
- __Spring Data R2DBC:__ Spring Data module for reactive database access using R2DBC
- __MapStruct:__ Used for mapping between domain entities and DTOs.
- __JUnit5:__ Testing framework for unit and integration testing in Java.
- __Spring Boot Test:__ Provides testing support for Spring Boot applications.
- __R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity):__ Reactive database driver for relational databases.
- __H2 Database:__ In-memory relational database for development and testing purposes
- __JSON:__ Data interchange format for communication between the client and the server.


 ### Conclusion:
 The MemberService examplifies modern Java development practices, leveraging reactive programming and clean architecture principles to build efficient and scalable microservices.
 It emphasizes modular design, separation of concerns, and test-driven development to ensure robustness and maintainability.
